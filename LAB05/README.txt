    Note: This lab is due before the longer hailstoneslab LAB04. 
    
    We read from a dictionary of words that is available on the hills system.
    
    We look for a kind of words that we will call 'rewords'; words that are still words when reversed.
    
    But, we don't want to include palindromes, so reversing the word must give a different word.    
    
        >>> is_reword('top')
        True
    
        >>> is_reword('pop')
        False
    
        >>> is_reword('whyask')
        False
    
    Best documentation for both words.py an rewords.py is to read the two test files
    tests/test_words.txt and tests/test_rewords.txt
    
    
    The instructions are similar to LAB03 and LAB04.
    
    Before submitting the assignment, replace the two lines with HERE 
    by the result of the commands above it.
